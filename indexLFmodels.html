<h1><center> Emission line luminosity functions </center></h1>

<p>
Emission-line galaxies will be a building block of the future large surveys that shall map the Universe in the uncharted redshift range 0.6&lt z &lt 1.7. 
They will provide galaxy maps spanning volumes spanning over tens of giga parsec cubes.
</p>

<p>
We gather all the spectroscopy acquired by the deep galaxy evolution surveys (VVDS, VIPERS, DEEP2) and measure the emission line fluxes in the spectra. 
Then we measure the evolution of the [OII] 3727, 3729 doublet (0.5 &lt z &lt 1.4), H beta 4862 (0.3 &lt z &lt 0.8) and [OIII] 5007 (0.2 &lt z &lt 0.8) emission-line luminosity function (LF). 
We concatenate our measurements with previous ones, if they were obtained independently, and find our data to be in agreement in agreement with previous studies. 
Using the complete data set, we fit a Saunders model to that accounts for the luminosity functions and its evolution with redshift. 
The [OII] 3727, 3729 doublet LF in the range 0 &lt z &lt 2.5 sees the log (L_*, \phi_*) increase by (1, 1.5) dex. 
The H beta 4862 LF over 0.3 &lt z &lt 0.8 has a similar shape than the \Ha LF. The [OIII] 5007 LF in the range 0 &lt z &lt 2 has a very rapid evolution of its bright end, twice as large as what [OII] 3727, 3729 undergoes. 

<p>
We investigate the impact of magnitude and color cuts on the completeness of observed LFs from VIPERS. An R band magnitude cut has a larger impact than an I band magnitude cut on the completeness. 
A blue color cut excises the brightest [OII] 3727, 3729 emitters and a red cut will exfilter the faintest emitters. 
Conversly, a color cut removes a fair share of the [OIII] 5007 emitter, regardless of their brightness.
</p>

<p>
We find a good agreement between the observations and the prediction of the semi-analytical models.
To inform the semi analytical models of galaxies, we measure the distribution of observed emission line luminosity ratios ,[OIII] 5007 / [OII] 3727, 3729 and [OIII] 5007 / H beta 4862, 
at redshift 0.76 in the DEEP2 data. The [OIII] 5007 / [OII] 3727, 3729 ratio has a narrow distribution centeres around 0.6. 
The [OIII] 5007 / H beta 4862 has a wide spread distribution over 1 - 3 and centered around 2.

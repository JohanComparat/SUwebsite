To overcome the cultural barrier and communicate or co-work efficiently, one needs a solid structure that in the case of cosmology can be reduced to a cluster of computers where data, code and resources are in open access and documented.  Skies and Universes is an attempt to create such a co-working space for cosmologists. It aims to be a very special place to connect ideas to data and theory in the most versatile, fluid manner.

<font size=6 style="color:#FFFFFF"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently exist many high-quality databases related to telescopes and virtual observatories: www.sdss.org, http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/, etc. But these are not directly connected with scientific code repositories, theoritical predictions nor computing facilities. This multiplication of interfaces between the scientist and these three entities, leads to great time losses. It makes scientific results completely reproducible, which is not always the case in modern physics.
